# Overview

## Project objectives
This project is aimed to desgin a web application providing bike rental in Dublin. 

## Target users
There are three main types of users for this application. The first one is local residents. Local office workers with short commute distance are likely to take bicycle instead of depending on public transport and car for both time and budget consideration. Besides, unlike sightseeing bus, riding bike allows tourists to follow their own rhythm. Last but not least, students may also ride bike to school for saving time in rush hours and keeping fit at the same time.
